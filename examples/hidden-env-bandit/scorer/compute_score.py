"""Grader for the hidden-env bandit example.

Grade-time flow (the env socket is already torn down by ``stop_env_server()``
before this runs):

1. Load the held-out env in-process via ``grading.load_env_module`` -- this is
   the SAME ``make_env(seed=0)`` the agent explored over the socket, so it
   carries the same hidden arm means.
2. Load the agent's submitted ``policy.py`` in a sandboxed worker via
   ``grading.load_submitted_policy`` (factory ``load_policy``); call
   ``policy.choose()`` to get the arm it believes is best.
3. Score continuously by how close the chosen arm's TRUE mean is to the optimal
   (1.0 for the best arm, ~0 for the worst). ``best_arm`` / ``mean`` are
   grader-only env methods (never socket-reachable), so the agent had to infer
   the best arm by pulling, not by asking.
